Assignment1:  
We will implement the logic to process transactions and produce the ledger.
Transactions are organized into time periods or blocks. In each block, we will receive a list of
transactions, validate the transactions you receive, and publish a list of validated transactions.

Assignment2:  
In this assignment we will implement a function that’s part of a block-chain-based distributed consensus
protocol. Specifically, our code will receive a block, validate this block and add it to the chain.
